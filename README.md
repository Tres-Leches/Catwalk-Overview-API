# Atelier API Optimization
Given a mock E-Commerce web application, the goal was to optimize the Atelier Product API route for high-traffic. Using an ETL process for sample data (over 1M records), database column indexing, local stress testing, load testing, horizontal scaling, load balancing, and caching, the system achieves a throughput of 9000 RPS with 600 ms latency and under 1% error rate.
